# Higher paid NBA players are (probably) deserving
The motivating question was to find out whether or not there existed a connection between the salary of an NBA player and his performance in the league. Using the statistic Player Efficiency Rating (PER), an NBA statistic commonly used to measure a player's overall performance in the league, I compared player salaries and performances. With a correlation of 0.5 between salary and PER across the leauge, as well as a Spearman Correlation of 0.4, I came to the conclusion that there was a slight correlation between the two variables, and thus higher paid NBA players may be deserving of their paychecks.
