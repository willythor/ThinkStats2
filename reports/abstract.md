The motivating question was to find out what a connection, if any, between the salary of and NBA player and his perforamnce in the league.

With a correlation of 0.5 between salary and PER (player efficency rating) across the leauge, as well as a Spearman Correlation of 0.4, I came to the conclusion that there was possibly a very slight correlation between the two variables.
