1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?

What percentage of alcohol abusers and those dependent on alcohol get treatment, and for those that do, what age do they tend to get treatment at?

2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

NSDUH, by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (formerly Office of Applied Studies), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

3) What analyses did the author perform?

create a survival curve for all who received treatment, as well as subcategories of those who received treatment.

4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

The analysis is helpful at explaining at what age, out of those who got treatment, someone got treatment. The analysis also answers the percentage question right off the bat.

5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

The report does a very good job at being clear, but the engagement is good, but the findings may need to be backed up further in a conclusion. Also, despite mentioning why in the conclusion, it wasn't clear to me why those marked as abusers that hadn't gotten treatment yet couldn't be included in the analysis.

6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?

Spelling, grammar, and formatting look good. The presentation looks professional.
