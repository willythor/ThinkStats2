Questions you should address in your review:

1) What is the primary motivating question of this report?

Is there a correlation between admission rates and average cost of attendance, and is there a correlation between mean earnings and average cost of attendance?


2) What dataset(s) does it use?  What person or agency produced the data?

us department of educations and college scoareboard 


3) What analyses did the author perform?

scatter plots, and qualitative observations of correlation.


4) Does the analysis provide an answer to the motivating question?

yes, this is very little correlation 
also the one outlier who earned 175k, and paid nothing for their education, who is that?? (trolling?)
also good point about the future investigation into more selective colleges


5) Does the report achieve a good balance between clarity (so the reader understands the analysis) and engagement (so the article is interesting and enjoyable for the reader)?

the methodology involving id numbers is a tiny bit too detailed
also what does 'predominantly award bachelor degrees' mean? what was the percentage cutoff?
would have been nice to know the actual correlations 


6) Is the quality of presentation professional, including details of spelling, grammar, and formatting?

yes
there was a problem where u presented decimal values instead of percentages on a graph
that data point with a college cost of attendance at zero, and a mean salary of 200k seems slightly implausible
