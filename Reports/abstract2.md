The goal of this article is to explore the association between drug usage and depression. Intuitively, many would argue that those who use drugs are more likely to be depressed. To explore this relationship, we took data from the National Drug Usage and Health Survey from 2014. We conducted logistical regression on cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, and heroin while controlling for possible confounding variables such as sex, income, and health conditions. Suprisingly, there appears to be a negative correlation between drug usage and depression.
